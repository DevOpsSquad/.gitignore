Good bug reports are extremely helpful, thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** – check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed in stable release** – try to reproduce it using 
   the latest `master` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** – create a live example and [write issue](https://github.com/whilex/whilex/issues) 
   on whilex official repository.
